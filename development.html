<b><u>Chapter 4:</u></b></br>
A summary of chapter 4 would be that in life, if you want to be successful, you need to know where you want to be in life and how far you are away from that. Moreover, just knowing what you want from life is the first step to reaching your dreams. Furthermore, to achieve the success you want or the dreams you have to set long-term and short-term goals for yourself. Additionally, with each goal, there should be a realistic timeline set for when it should be achieved. Even tho success can’t be achieved overnight, it doesn’t mean that a person can’t set their mindset towards their goal in one night. In addition, it won't necessarily be easy and at times might be hard, but knowing what you want, you will find a solution to any problem. And even though a person's goals may take time, as long as they are in the right direction, a person may achieve anything they put their mind to.</br></br>


<b>How does this align with me?</b></br>
As a person, this type of advice is very useful to me, as many times I feel like I lack a sense of direction in the sense of not knowing what I want or how long it might take. I want to be successful, but I don't know where to start or what success should look like to me. This could help gain a sense of direction and understand where to start and figure out what success I might want. For instance, many times I want to study but don’t know what I should gain after studying each subject, hence many times I end up wasting time on unnecessary information or giving up because I don’t know what direction to take. In contrast, this advice could help me organize my study time and make a study plan with a specific timeframe and objectives and goals in mind. Thus giving me a feeling of purpose and drive as I know what my ultimate goal would be, thus helping to be successful in my studying, testing, future careers and anything I want to achieve in life.</br></br>


<b><u>Chapter 5:</u></b></br>
A summary of chapter five is that rather than spending your time doing things that just should be done, obituary. It's important to spend your time or days wisely doing things that benefit you and your goals by planning and carefully managing your time. Furthermore, by doing this, your time will be well spent, and in the end, you will be left with little to regret about the time you spent.</br></br>


<b>How does this align with me?</b></br>
When it comes to time management, I have a bad experience, as I often waste it either on procrastinating or on meaningless things. Now with this new understanding, it will help me better understand what to do with my time and cut out bad habits, thus allowing me to use my time more efficiently.</br></br>


<b><u>Chapter 6:</u></b></br>

A summary of chapter six is that oftentimes in life, success and growth are determined by the people you surround yourself with. Furthermore, how you form relationships may allow you to grow or stay stagnant, so it is important to surround yourself with those who are where you want to be or who have the same ambitions as yourself. Additionally, with this, you will be challenged to grow more and push each other, while those who are unsuccessful and have no ambitions of growth may pull you down with them, hence stifling your growth. So it is important to limit or end relationships with such a person and form relationships with those who have ambitions to be successful.</br></br>
<b>How does this align with me?</b></br>

The people that I have surrounded myself with were never something I questioned before, as I had not thought they had such effects on me Now with learning this, I will reevaluate the close relationships I have formed and see those with whom I should grow my relationship with and those I should limit my time with.</br></br>

<b><u>Chapter 7:</u></b></br>
A summary of chapter seven is that in life, if one wants to be successful, they need to constantly be learning. Moreover, even though formal education is important, it is more important to self-educate, as it is a vital part of one's success. There are different forms of learn, whether by learning from a successful person, learning and reflecting on oneself or learning from books; these will all allow a person to grow and become successful.</br></br>

<b>How does it align with me?</b></br>
For me, I previously thought learning was mainly done in schools and by teachers and such but after reading chapter seven, my eyes have been opened. Furthermore, I can use my time to read books, which I previously didn't do in my free time, to increase my knowledge, hence allowing me to become more knowledgeable and, in the future, even more successful.
