</ul>
<center><h3> Relentless </h3></center>

<p><b>Description:</b></br>
Being relentless means I will never give up easily, even when I am faced with challenges or setbacks in life. I will stay focused on my goals, mission and push through difficult tasks until I have achieved success in anything i put my mind to.</br></br>
<b>Impact on School/Academic Life:</b></br>
This personality trait helps me stay determined when studying subjects I am weaker at or completing demanding projects. Even if I don’t understand a topic right away, I will practice until I have completely learned it. My persistence will inspire classmates and others around me to stay motivated as well in their endeavours.</p>

<center><h3> Observant <h3></center>
<p><b>Description:</b>
I usually pay close attention to details and notice things that others might overlook, with this, I can see the bigger pic and the smaller ones that make it up. This helps me understand situations better and make thoughtful and well-rounded decisions.</br></br>

<b>Impact on School/Academic Life:</b></br>
Being observant allows me to quickly identify mistakes in my work and learn from them. In group projects, I often notice things or details that can be improved and help my group stay organized. This personality trait also helps me understand lessons better because I listen carefully and observe how teachers explain new topics and also how to relate them back to the other things I have learned.</p>

<center><h3> Adaptable </h3> </center>
<p><b>Description:</b>
Being adaptable means I can adjust to new situations, environments, or challenges without becoming overwhelmed and also grow after overcoming them. I am open to change and quick to find new ways of solving problems.</br></br>

<b>Impact on School/Academic Life:</b></br>
This personality trait helps me handle unexpected changes, such as new subjects, assignments, or teaching styles. When working in groups or using new technology, I adjust easily and help others adapt too. My flexibility allows me to perform well in different learning environments and stay calm under pressure.</P>

<center><h3>My Hero and Their Influence</h3></center>
<p>
<b>My Hero’s Name: Martin Luther King Jr</b></br>
<b>who was he:</b></br>
Martin Luther King Jr. was an American civil rights leader who fought against racial segregation and injustice through peaceful protest. He is best known for his leadership in the Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s and for his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, which called for equality and unity among all people.</br></br>

<b>My Favourite Quote:</b><br>
“The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.”</br></br>

<b>Explanation and Impact he had on me as a person:</b></br>
This quote inspires me because it reminds me that true strength and character are shown during difficult times, not when life is easy or comfortable, especially in times like these, where it's much easier to do bad than good. Martin Luther King Jr. faced many challenges, including threats, violence, and imprisonment, yet he continued to stand up for justice and equality. I admire his courage and determination, his relentless spirit when it came to change. His example motivates and drives me to stay strong when faced with challenges in school or life and to always do what is right, even when no one is around to see and even when it is not easy.</P><br>

<h3>Report on Favourite AI Business Idea</h3>
 <p>“A Report on My Favourite AI Business Idea from' Top 20 Profitable AI Business Ideas in 2025”</P>
<p>
<b>Introduction / Overview of the Blog</b></br>
The blog “Top 20 Profitable AI Business Ideas in 2025” showcases many different ways to make a business using AI by solving simple or complex problems that people may be having on a day-to-day basis. The variety of options that are available solves a wide pool of issues or makes current operations more efficient and sometimes more cost-effective, thus allowing businesses listed to be more attractive to customers, hence more successful.</br></br>


<b><u>My favourite Idea from the List</u></b></br>
My favourite idea from the list was AI-based adaptive learning systems, as it can currently apply to my own situation and would be beneficial for me as it would solve learning and academic issues I am facing.</br></br>

<b>Brief description:</b> This is a business idea that focuses on helping people learn regardless of their learning styles or the time they might have available. Furthermore, the system would take into consideration its users' strengths and weaknesses and create personalised courses or activities that would be most effective in helping its users learn. Examples of this are mnemonics, images and graphs.</br></br>


<b><u>Application in My World & Usefulness:</u></b></br>
This could be used at my school to help my peers who are trying to catch up on lectures and such. There could be an app where, based on the info they put in and level of learning they are at, a personalised course could be made to help them catch in no time
As many times unavoidable circumstances may appear in a student's life where or she is unable to attend classes for a while and this would help to bridge that gap, allowing that student to smoothly transition back into class without playing catch-up.</br>

Another scenario doesn’t even have to be a student but just a regular person who wants to learn a skill in their free time; this come in hand as would be allowed to learn on their own time in a manner they are most comfortable with.</br></br>



<b><u>Ethical Issues & Moral Concerns</b></u></br>
An ethical issue that may arise would be that the user may become over-reliant on this system and may completely stop learning from official paths, such as schools and such.</br>
The issue with this is that as humans we need to socialise and with this constant reliance on this tool an users' social skills may degrade over time.</br>
<b><u>solution:</u></b></br>
An solution to this to use the system along side official paths thus person will still socialise and improve their social skills while learning more  effeciently</br></br>

<b><u>Real-World Example / App</b></u></br>
A real-life example of an adaptive learning system would be a learning platform named RealizeIt.</br>

<b>what is Realiseit</b></br>
Realizeit is a platform that delivers personalized, role-based, and verified learning experiences for high-stakes roles and skills.</br>

<b><a href="https://www.realizeitlearning.com/"target="_blank">visits realizeit website</a></b></br></br>
<U><b>Conclusion / Reflection</b></u></br>
In conclusion, AI-based adaptive learning systems can make education more personalized and accessible for all learners. Although overreliance may be a concern, using the system alongside traditional schooling can create balance. Overall, this idea could greatly improve how students like myself learn and succeed.
